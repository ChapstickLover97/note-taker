# note-taker-final
This app is my attempt to make a note-taking app that will take in data, save it to a DB, and then be able to be retrieved at a later date for either memory retention or making adjustments

## Installation
Download code, run npm i && npm start, you'll see "Live at http://localhost:3001"

## Usage
For taking notes and reminding yourself of what other items need to be taken care of in daily life
